You see me smoking in the movie, actually. Like so many millions of people, I smoked because I thought it was glamorous and a great way to look mature. Actors did it. Presidents did it. Even athletes smoked. I remember Arnold Palmer swinging a golf club with a cigarette in his hand. There used to be so much smoke at boxing matches, they&rsquo;d call them &ldquo;smokers.&rdquo; Smoking was sensual, sexy, mysterious, and&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;it was killing people. You certainly don&rsquo;t need me to tell you about the damage nicotine can do.</p>                      <p align="left" class="copy">I&rsquo;d gotten away with the habit for years, but when I really started pushing my body for <em>Rocky</em>, I knew I had to quit. When I first started training for those fight scenes with Carl Weathers, I&rsquo;d start gasping after 30 seconds. It was like someone had parked a Buick on my chest. Quitting was next to impossible. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I said, &ldquo;This is my last cigarette.&rdquo; After maybe 200 attempts, I somehow managed to go a month without one and discovered how much more I could taste and smell. In fact, that was what ultimately got me to stop. After being away from cigarettes for a while, I walked into a room where people had been smoking and I got nauseous. That sealed it. </p>                      </td>                  </tr>                </table>            </div>            <p align="left"><span class="header"><strong><span class="style8"><strong><a name="big" id="big"></a></strong></span><img src="../food/bar.jpg" width="760" height="30" align="top"></strong></span></p>            <div align="left">              <table width="680" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">                <tr>                  <td><h1 class="header">Big like Me: The Gains and Pains of <em>Cop land</em></h1>                    <p class="copy">In 1997, I starred with Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel, and Ray Liotta in a film about a downtrodden small-town New Jersey cop who uncovers corruption in the NYPD. <em>Cop Land</em> got good reviews, but most people remember it for how overweight I was in it. The director insisted that my character, Sheriff Freddy Heflin, be as soft-bellied as he was sad. I decided to play him like a human turtle&mdash;slow, unsteady, terrified of the world. As soon as I read the script, I knew I&rsquo;d have to gain weight. Lots of weight. </p>                    <p class="copy">Over the course of three months, I packed on 40 pounds and went from a 31-inch waist to a 39 1/2-inch waist. In the process, I learned a tremendous amount about the physiology and psychology of being overweight.</p>                    <p class="copy">First, I saw how easy it is to put on pounds. I&rsquo;d wake up in the morning and do nothing. No exercise, no stretching, no problem. I&rsquo;d head over to a place called the Royal Canadian Pancake House&mdash;after a while, I started calling it &ldquo;the trough&rdquo;&mdash;and eat whatever I wanted. Some days it would be five pancakes, some days 10, whatever I could handle, and I always topped it with mountains of whipped cream and washed it down with chocolate milk.</p>                    <p class="copy">These pancakes were so big, you could put an axle in them and drive home. God, I miss those days. Then again, I don&rsquo;t.</p>                    <p class="copy">For a while, I loved bulking up. I actually had fun. After decades of being conscientious about my weight, it was a fantastic relief to let go.</p>                    <p class="copy">But then the check came.</p>                    <p class="copy">I developed sciatica, heart palpitations, debilitating acid reflux, digestion problems, and headaches. My cholesterol and blood pressure levels were astronomically high. Those afternoon energy lapses soon turned into full-fledged exhaustion; as a special added bonus, I got a full-blown case of sleep apnea. In one year I&rsquo;d gone from the best abs to the worst adenoids.</p>                    <p class="copy">As soon as production wrapped, I went on my version of the Atkins diet, which was about 80 percent protein and the rest just good fats: Nuts, avocado, olive oil, things like that. I got back into a regular cardio routine and started weight training again. I lost 40 pounds in 60 days without killing myself. Muscle memory is an amazing thing.</p>                    <p class="copy">I finally understood the uncomfortable situations being physically overweight puts people into, which is the reason I wanted to do this book.</p>                    </td>                </tr>              </table>              <p><span class="header"><strong><a name="going" id="going"></a><img src="../food/bar.jpg" width="760" height="30" align="top"></strong></span></p>            </div>            <div align="center"></div>            <div align="center"></div>            <div align="center"></div>            <div align="center"></div>            <table width="600" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">              <tr>                <td valign="top"><h1 class="header">Going the Distance</h1>                  <p class="copy">If three out of four diets fail, is there any hope of losing weight and actually keeping it off? The National Weight Control Registry is a list of people who&rsquo;ve lost at least 30 pounds and kept the weight off for one year or more. Here&rsquo;s what the world&rsquo;s happiest losers have in common:</p>                  <p class="copy">1. Move: Every day. Take a half hour walk and combine it with things you should be doing anyway, like taking the stairs, playing with your kids, putting down the remote, and actually getting up to change the channel.</p>                  <p class="copy">2. Eat Breakfast: A nutritious breakfast that&rsquo;s rich in fruits and fiber stops you from binge eating later in the day. For me, there&rsquo;s nothing better than hot Irish oatmeal with blueberries.</p>                  <p class="copy">3. Weigh Yourself: The scale is the best lie detector. The registry&rsquo;s losers monitor their weight several times a week. That way, if you&rsquo;re gaining, you know you need to take action sooner to stay on track.</p>                  <p class="copy">4. Read Labels: You&rsquo;d be surprised how many calories, sugar, and fat some products have. Get used to reading ingredient lists and nutritional labels. It&rsquo;s your best defense against bringing fats and those bad carbs into your home.</p>                  <p class="copy">5. Eat Smart: Smart weight losers generally limit the volume, the amount, of whatever they choose to eat. Portion size is three-quarters of the battle.</p>                  </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p><span class="header"><strong><a name="water" id="water"></a><img src="../food/bar.jpg" width="760" height="30" align="top"></strong></span></p>            <table width="600" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">              <tr>                <td valign="top"><h1 class="header">Water, Water, Every Day</h1>                  <p class="copy">Eight glasses. Ten glasses. A gallon. Lake Michigan.</p>                  <p class="copy">Everybody has a different opinion about how much water we need every day to stay healthy and strong. I try not to worry about it, especially since there&rsquo;s little scientific evidence to confirm we need the standard eight glasses a day.</p>                  <p class="copy">When I get up in the morning, I drink a tall glass first thing to replenish fluids and optimize the body&rsquo;s various systems. Your body will thank you. We get dehydrated at night. Then I&rsquo;ll have a glass at all my meals; sometimes I&rsquo;ll drink flavored water to liven things up. As you&rsquo;ll remember from sixth-grade science class, water accounts for roughly 60 percent of our total body weight, and even mild dehydration can tire you out, weaken your muscles, and kill your concentration.</p>                  <p class="copy">Of course, the more you sweat, the more you need to drink. I start drinking water about 15 minutes before I get to the gym, drink while I&rsquo;m working out and then drink to help my recovery for an hour or so after. It helps the joints stay loose and, if you&rsquo;re in weight-loss mode, it speeds the fat burning process. One tip: Drink cold water. The body needs to heat it, which requires more energy, which burns more calories.</p>                  </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p><span class="header"><strong><a name="sly" id="sly"></a><img src="../food/bar.jpg" width="760" height="30" align="top"></strong></span></p>            <table width="600" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">              <tr>                <td valign="top"><h1 align="left" class="header">Sly Holidays</h1>                  <p align="left" class="copy">Holidays are supposed to be a break from reality.

Promise yourself you&rsquo;ll stay on that treadmill an extra 15 minutes for two or three days and then you&rsquo;ll be even. It&rsquo;s very simple mathematics: whatever you put into your body, you can take away with the right combination of cardio and smart eating. </p>                  </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p align="left"><span class="header"><strong><a name="seasons" id="seasons"></a><img src="../food/bar.jpg" width="760" height="30" align="top"></strong></span></p>            <table width="600" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">              <tr>                <td><h1 class="header">Season&rsquo;s Eatings</h1>                  <p class="copy">When I was a kid, the only seasonal ingredient I really thought about was canned cranberry sauce. Times have changed. Living in California, I&rsquo;m blessed with some of the freshest fruits and vegetables in the world all year long. Fortunately, in recent years, farmers&rsquo; markets and better grocery stores have been popping up around the country to put seasonal and organic produce within everyone&rsquo;s reach.</p>                  <p class="copy">Paying attention to what&rsquo;s in season is my favorite way to keep my diet from getting stale. Many of these items aren&rsquo;t on my food list, because they&rsquo;re only available for a short time each year; that&rsquo;s what makes them so special. I really recommend seeking out farmers&rsquo; markets in your area. That&rsquo;s where flavors are usually at their peak, and shopping at these markets is a way to support farming traditions that are being eroded by our urban society.</p>                  <p class="copy">Probably the easiest way to know what&rsquo;s fresh is to look at what&rsquo;s cheapest in the market. </p>                  </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p><span class="header"><strong><a name="top10" id="top10"></a><img src="../food/bar.jpg" width="760" height="30" align="top"></strong></span></p>            <table width="600" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">              <tr>                <td valign="top"><h1 class="header">Sly&rsquo;s Top 10 Tips for Life</h1>                  <p class="copy">10.

Pursue them!<br>                      7. If other people can steal your idea, most likely they will.<br>                      6. Don&rsquo;t be afraid of embarrassment while pursuing your goal.
